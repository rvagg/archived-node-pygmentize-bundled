# Pygmentize (Bundled)

**Python's Pygments code formatter, for Node.js, distributed with Pygments**

[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/pygmentize-bundled.png?downloads=true&stars=true&downloadRank=true)](https://nodei.co/npm/pygmentize-bundled/) [![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm-dl/pygmentize-bundled.png?months=6&height=3)](https://nodei.co/npm/pygmentize-bundled/)

Can be used as either a *String-in, Buffer-out*, or as a Duplex stream.

Compatible with both Python v2 and v3.

**Note**: this library makes use of a child process which calls Python to invoke Pygments. This can cause performance problems where a large number of code blocks are being separately formatted. Consider using **[pygmentize-bundled-cached](https://github.com/rvagg/pygmentize-bundled-cached)**, an API-compatible wrapper for this library that keeps an on-disk cache of formatted code samples which will result in significantly faster formats when repeatedly formatting the same blocks of code.

**Note 2**: this is a *Node.js-only* library and will *not* work in the browser, since Python is not available in the browser. For front-end highlighting, choose [a pure-JavaScript library](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=syntax+highlighting).

## API

**pygmentize(options, code, callback)**

Pygmentize a given `code` string and return it as a Buffer to the `callback` Function.

* `options` contains options to be passed to Pygments (see [Options](#options)).
* `code` is a String to be formatted.
* `callback` is a Function, called when complete. The first argument will be an `error` object/string if there was a problem and the second argument will be a Buffer containing your formatted code.

**pygmentize(options)**

When you only supply the `options` argument, it will return a Duplex stream that you can pipe to and from to format your code.

* `options` contains options to be passed to Pygments (see [Options](#options)).

## Options

Language/lexer, formatter, and their options are currently supported. Filters are not supported yet.

* `lang`: source language/lexer name - `String`
* `format`: output formatter name - `String`
* `python`: the full path to the `python` command on the current system, defaults to `'python'` - `String`
* `options`: lexer and formatter options, each key/value pair is passed through to `pygmentize` with `-P` - `Object`

## Examples

The string interface is very simple:

```js
var pygmentize = require('pygmentize-bundled')

pygmentize({ lang: 'js', format: 'html' }, 'var a = "b";', function (err, result) {
  console.log(result.toString())
})
```

Results in:

```html
<div class="highlight"><pre>
  <span class="kd">var</span>
  <span class="nx">a</span>
  <span class="o">=</span>
  <span class="s2">&quot;b&quot;</span>
  <span class="p">;</span>
</pre></div>
```

Example with extra options:

```js
var pygmentize = require('pygmentize-bundled')

pygmentize({ lang: 'php', format: 'html', options: { startinline: 1 } }, 'var a = true;', function (err, result) {
  console.log(result.toString())
})
```

A duplex streaming API is also available. Simply omit the `code` and `callback` arguments:

```js
var pygmentize = require('pygmentize-bundled')

process.stdin
  .pipe(pygmentize({ lang: 'js', format: 'html' }))
  .pipe(process.stdout);
```
